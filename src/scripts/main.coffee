Finally, Rob takes me into a vacant lot and says, 'Here we are!' Well, we sat there for a year and a half. Sure enough, someone constructed a bar around us! Well, the day they opened it, we ordered a shot, drank it and then burnt the place to the ground. Rob yelled over the roar of the flames, 'Always leave things the way you found them!'",
      "So anyways, Rob would put on a white tie and tails and walk his pet cobra through the park on a leash. He named the cobra 'Beverly'. He taught it how to fetch and dial a phone. But then one day, it bit the maid. So with tears in his eyes, Rob had to shoot the maid.",

      "He once ate the bible while water skiing!",
